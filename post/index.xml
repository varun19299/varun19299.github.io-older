      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we shall explore the key steps of &lt;strong&gt;Large Scale Direct SLAM&lt;/strong&gt; (LSD SLAM) and understand its main strengths and weaknesses. We shall also see how we can possibly overcome some of these limitations with recent advances in Computational Photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-lsd-slam&#34;&gt;What is LSD SLAM?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LSD SLAM stands for &lt;strong&gt;Large Scale Direct SLAM&lt;/strong&gt;, implying that it performs simultaneous localisation and mapping &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; on the entire set of image intensities, instead of relying on a subset of points such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SIFT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_from_accelerated_segment_test&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FAST&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_FAST_and_rotated_BRIEF&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ORB&lt;/a&gt; features. Essentially, this allows LSD SLAM to utilise all the information available in the image and thereby not discard crucial information contained in edges, which constitutes a major portion of the scene being mapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where LSD SLAM crucially differs from earlier direct SLAM methods \cite, is the ingenious methods adopted for tracking and depth estimation. Depth estimation is done via &lt;strong&gt;small baseline&lt;/strong&gt; stereo which allows for much fewer outliers. Tracking is done using direct image alignment over a subset of frames. These modifications allow LSD SLAM to be run real-time even with just a CPU. In comparison, previous approaches such as \cite required a complete high-end GPU to run real-time. &lt;strong&gt;The main novelty in this work include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;utilising key-frames to simplify monocular SLAM. Semi-dense depth maps are propogated only for key-frames and map optimisation is done only for their poses. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This reduces the complexity of the bundle adjustment problem by a large margin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;utilising a scale-aware image alignment algorithm to directly estimate the similarity transform &lt;code&gt;$\xi ∈ \mathcal{sim}(3)$&lt;/code&gt; between two keyframes. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;By doing so, we aren&amp;rsquo;t restricted to only points pertaining to hand-engineered features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporation of uncertainty of the estimated depth into tracking. For every point, before solving the correspondence problem, we roughly estimate whether it is worthwhile to do so, ie., &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is the computational cost worth the gain in depth accuracy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;$\mathcal{sim}-3$&lt;/code&gt; is the lie algebra of the Special Euclidean Objects group (SE-3). A lie algebra offers easier optimisation of variables by linearising the manifold of consideration. Intuitively, if we consider just rotation as a matrix, then it must be constrained to be orthogonal &lt;code&gt;($U^TU=I$)&lt;/code&gt;. However, if we were optimising it with, say, gradient descent, then there is no guarantee that the resulting matrix would be orthogonal. Further, we only want to optimise on a subset of &lt;code&gt;$\mathbb{R}^{4\times 4}$&lt;/code&gt;. Lie algebras encapsulate this effectively: the resultant &lt;code&gt;$\mathcal{sim}-3 \in \mathbb{R}^6$&lt;/code&gt; can be optimised by gradient descent. For more details, we refer you to (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-pipeline&#34;&gt;Main Pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;














&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Fig 1: Overview of LSD SLAM.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pipeline follows:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute incoming pose via direct image alignment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide whether to initialise a key-frame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute depth via small baseline stereo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat, finally perform map optimisation to correct for scale ambiguity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shall elaborate on each of these main steps in the sections below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;concept-of-keyframes&#34;&gt;Concept of Keyframes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, LSD SLAM heavily utilises the concept of keyframes: &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; frames, which are initialised when a new frame has a pose significantly different from the current keyframe. The very first frame is taken to be a key-frame, with random normal depth, and random normal depth uncertainity. Map optimisation is performed only on the set of key-frames, further lowering computational costs associated with bundle adjustment and loop closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each key-frame $K_j$ consists of an &lt;strong&gt;image frame, depth map, uncertainity map and pose vector&lt;/strong&gt; - denoted by the tuple &lt;code&gt;$(I_j, D_j, U_j, p_j)$&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;$I_j \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n \times 3}$&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$D_j \in \mathbb{R^+}^{m\times n}$&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$U_j \in \mathbb{R^+}^{m\times n}$&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$p_j \in \mathbb{R}^6$&lt;/code&gt;. For non-key frames, we are not concerned with depth or uncertainity, and each non-key frame &lt;code&gt;$NK_j$&lt;/code&gt; consists of the tuple &lt;code&gt;$(I_j, p_j)$&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;direct-image-alignment&#34;&gt;Direct Image Alignment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of direct image aligment is to use a key-frame  &lt;code&gt;$K_i$&lt;/code&gt; and a new-frame &lt;code&gt;$I_j$&lt;/code&gt; to determine &lt;code&gt;$p_j$&lt;/code&gt;. This is done by a warping, where we project points from one image using the available depth information. If we know the pose of the second image, then we can recover the second image from these projected points. Thus, by optimising a function of the form below, we can find the pose of the second image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$\begin{align} p_j = \text{argmin}_p f(I_i - I_j[warp(D_i, p)]) \end{align} $$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commonly used &lt;code&gt;$f$&lt;/code&gt;, also called residue function, include &lt;code&gt;$f(x - y) = ||x-y||^2$&lt;/code&gt; (MSE), or the hinge function (which ignores outliers), or L1 distance etc.&lt;/p&gt;














&lt;figure&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;warping.gif&#34; data-caption=&#34;Fig 2: Warping images from the TUM room sequence.&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;warping.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1200&#34; height=&#34;750&#34; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Fig 2: Warping images from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TUM room sequence&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the above figure, we demonstrate inverse image warping. These images have been taken from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TUM room sequence&lt;/a&gt;, a common SLAM benchmarking dataset. Black regions correspond to points where the Kinect failed to output any depth. Except when the target pose matches the source pose, this results in zero intensity regions. Providing a more complete depth map can offset this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since warping is so sensitive to depth information, it is important we optimise this function or residue only over points with lower variance in depth. This is where we can incorporate the uncertainity matrix &lt;code&gt;$U_i$&lt;/code&gt;. One way of doing this is to divide the residue function element-wise by the uncertainity, yielding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$\begin{align} p_j = \text{argmin}_p f(\frac{I_i - I_j[warp(D_i, p)]}{g(U_i)}) \end{align} $$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warp function, &lt;code&gt;$w(D, p):$ pixel $\to$ pixel&lt;/code&gt;, takes a depth map &lt;code&gt;$D$&lt;/code&gt; and a pixel point &lt;code&gt;$p$&lt;/code&gt; and computes the corresponding pixel point in frame &lt;code&gt;$j$&lt;/code&gt;. This requires projection to 3D world coordinates and re-projection to the second camera frame. Both of these require knowledge of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ftp.cs.toronto.edu/pub/psala/VM/camera-parameters.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;camera parameters&lt;/a&gt;, which we implicitly assume to be known here. Written as a minimisation objective (sum over all pixels &lt;code&gt;$q \in \Sigma_D \subset [m]\times[n]$&lt;/code&gt; in the image), this becomes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$\begin{align} p_j = \text{argmin}_p \sum_{q \in \Sigma_D \subset [m]\times[n]} f(\frac{I_i[q] - I_j[warp(D_i[q], p)]}{g(U_i[q])}) \end{align} $$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving us a similar objective as in Figure 1. LSD SLAM adopts &lt;code&gt;$g(U_i[q])= 2\sigma^2 + \frac{df(I_i[q] - I_j[warp(D_i[q], p)])}{dD_i[q]}^2U_i[q]$&lt;/code&gt;. Intuitively, this penalises regions with continuous image intensity variation lesser than those with abrupt variations. We minimise this objective only over a subset of points for which we know depth information, hence being &lt;strong&gt;semi-dense image alignment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that we have not utilised quite a bit of prior information here. For instance, in the above picture, if you knew two corners of the monitor, you know where the other lie, since the monitor is rectangular. Using such information (priors) can greatly help improve the optimisation landscape. We shall discuss more about incorporating such data-driven priors in the limitations section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we are optimising over the pose vector &lt;code&gt;$p_j$&lt;/code&gt;. As a matrix, which is commonly used for such projective functions, the pose matrix has 16 entries. However, due to scale and rigid body constraints, this works out to just 6 degrees of freedom (dof). It is important to optimise the function over a linear landscape (or manifold), since it makes it much easier to converge towards an optimal solution. Here&amp;rsquo;s where the &lt;strong&gt;lie algebra&lt;/strong&gt; comes into play: it represents a linear manifold of the lie group, which is our pose matrix here. You can employ familiar first and second order optimisers including gradient descent, newton&amp;rsquo;s method etc., but the most common is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss–Newton_algorithm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gauss-Newton&lt;/a&gt; optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;choosing-key-frames&#34;&gt;Choosing Key-frames&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivation for choosing key-frames follows a very simple observation - LSD SLAM utilises small-baseline stereo matching, and hence it would be desirable if all the frames belonging to a particular key-frame group (all frames &lt;code&gt;$NK_j$&lt;/code&gt; between &lt;code&gt;$K_i, K_{i+1}$&lt;/code&gt;) are &amp;ldquo;close&amp;rdquo; to the key-frame &lt;code&gt;$K_i$&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, initialise a new key-frame if,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$||p_j - p_i||&amp;gt; \rho $$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you initialise a new key-frame, use the projected points from the previous key-frames to initialise its depth map. The uncertainity map is similarly projected. Note that this might be semi-dense since not all projected points would cover the new key-frame. Here, to incorporate scale-drift tracking, LSD SLAM normalises the mean inverse depth to be 1. Scale awareness is incorporated during the final map-optimisation across various key-frames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;small-baseline-stereo-matching&#34;&gt;Small baseline stereo matching&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We perform many small baseline stereo-matching operations to refine the depth map of the key-frame &lt;code&gt;$K_i$&lt;/code&gt;. We do not compute depth maps for non-key frames. In a similar manner to (2), only refinements where stereo depth is of higher confidence based on the accuracy of disparity search. This essentially allows us to propogate a semi-dense depth map throughout the whole SLAM pipeline, aiding computational simplicity. Such regions are often those with rich texture, which is expected in stereo based depth estimation.&lt;/p&gt;














&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;map-optimisation&#34;&gt;Map Optimisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of tracking, we obtain a set of key-frames and their coarse pose-estimates. We are left with two pending tasks: (a) &lt;strong&gt;Incorporate global scale into these coarse pose-estimates&lt;/strong&gt;. Remember, we initialised the depth map of a new key-frame with mean inverse depth as 1. (b) &lt;strong&gt;Further refine poses by minimising overall entropy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We achieve the first by doing a similar photometric residual minimisation, but here over &lt;code&gt;$\xi ∈ \mathcal{sim}(3)$&lt;/code&gt;, which has 7-degrees of freedom, the additional dof representing scale. This allows us to find scale parameters which best satisfy other key-frame constraints. This is written as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$\begin{align} p_j = \text{argmin}_p \sum_{q \in \Sigma_D \subset [m]\times[n]} f(\frac{I_i[q] - I_j[warp(D_i[q], p)]}{g_1(U_i[q])} + \frac{D_i[q] - D_j[warp(D_i[q], p)]}{g_2(U_i[q])}) \end{align} $$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;$g_2$&lt;/code&gt; is another smoothening term with respect to &lt;code&gt;$D_i[q] - D_j[warp(K_i[q], p)]$&lt;/code&gt;. Again observe that map-optimisation is performed only among key-frames, hence we have access to &lt;code&gt;$D_j$&lt;/code&gt;. In practice, &lt;code&gt;$\mathcal{sim}(3)$&lt;/code&gt; tracking is computationally similar to &lt;code&gt;$\mathcal{se}(3)$&lt;/code&gt; tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;limitations-of-lsd-slam&#34;&gt;Limitations of LSD SLAM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While LSD SLAM certainly does produce quite impressive results, it does have its fair share of limitations too. We discuss the fundamental challenges behind a few of these below. Most of these limitations arise due to the restricted information available in a monocular video stream. And this is precisely where Computational Photography can be leveraged. By further considering information from physical camera models and their corresponding optics, we can alleviate a few of these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;














&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;scale-ambiguity&#34;&gt;Scale Ambiguity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monocular depth estimation techniques tends to lack a sense of absolute global scale. Thus, although our relative pose estimations within each key-frame may be accurate, this is no guarantee regarding the global map. While the map-optimisation procedure aims to mitigate this ambiguity, it is worthwhile noting that the &lt;code&gt;$\mathcal{sim}(3)$&lt;/code&gt; objective is non-convex and hence depends to a major extent on the initialisation parameters. This step limits the convergence radius, which is how far LSD SLAM works before producing an inconsistent map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A later paper from TU Munich - &amp;ldquo;CNN SLAM&amp;rdquo;, CVPR 2017 (4) -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This blog post is meant to serve as a journal or a log of sorts of my learnings and reflections in a course I took up this semester (Fall 2019). Technically, owing to its sparse insertions, it is barely a journal, maybe more of a reflection. And certainly no memoir! It is not meant to be a reliable course transcript and as such might skim on some portions, while emphasising on others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;table-of-contents&#34;&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#understanding-your-personality&#34;&gt;Understanding your Personality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;search-for-purpose&#34;&gt;Search for Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this introductory module, we began by discussing our expectations and aspirations from the course. For me, I wanted to use this course as a much needed opportunity for introspection, perhaps meet a few new people (&lt;em&gt;at insti, you can never  have met everyone!&lt;/em&gt;) and may be some wise take-home advice would be an added bonus. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit, 19th November, 2019:&lt;/strong&gt; After spending a semester in the course, I can say I received a lot more than my initial objectives, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad about it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began with the goal of visioning with a little help from a certain Eastern concept.  &lt;strong&gt;Ikigai&lt;/strong&gt;, roughly translating to &amp;ldquo;thing that you live for&amp;rdquo;, is the Japanese concept of finidng a purpose in life. The philosphy revolves around the idea that once you discover your true, unwaivering purpose in life, the journey called life becomes much more meaningful. This philosophy historically originates as a ritualisitc practice from the southern most prefecture of Japan, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_Prefecture&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Okinawa&lt;/a&gt; on the islands of Ryuku. For long, the inhabitants of the island  have been quentissentially associated with the lack of any desire to retire. They continue, as long as their physical bodies permit,  doing their favourtie activities. In fact they wake up everyday with the desire to perform that activity. Which is quite ironic compared to our modern lives, where people as early as their 30&amp;rsquo;s start thinking about retirement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a famous TED Talk (inset below), National Geographic reporter &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Buettner&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dan Buettner&lt;/a&gt; posited this existence of a definite reason to be the cause for the long lifespans of the island&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants. This sort of feels intuitive to me (and hopefully to a lot of others too!). Having a purpose, something you wake up to each day, can be pretty satisfying. And that often translates to happiness and general well-being. In the course, taking inspiration from the same, we set out on a small exercise to find our &amp;ldquo;purpose&amp;rdquo; in life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ff40YiMmVkU&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At the onset, this did not make much sense to me. Yes, goal making is important and is quite often stressed in many work-ethic related workshops. But there&amp;rsquo;s one caveat to goal making: finding the right goal, especially since it is not trivial to understand what is relevant. Luckily, the ikigai addresses this too, by asking four insightful questions. It asks first what you love to do, something which gives you joy of some form or doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like a burden when you do it. Second, what is it that you do well. This could include activities in which you are skilled or talented. You may or may not derive satisfaction out of this. Intersecting these two question should give you a list of things you&amp;rsquo;re passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;














&lt;figure&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://miro.medium.com/max/1124/1*cJk9deGJ2aizplaTslEXLA.jpeg&#34; &gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://miro.medium.com/max/1124/1*cJk9deGJ2aizplaTslEXLA.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Notice that this question isn&amp;rsquo;t concerned with how others perceive your tasks. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s the third. What are things you do that others value? This could be monetary value, intellectual value or even a non-materialistic value. But it might be easier for you to relate to this question if you rephrase it as: &amp;ldquo;what is it that people are willing to pay me for?&amp;rdquo;. Here, the intersection of the second and third questions give you a profession: something you are skilled at, and is valuable to others. The final question, and maybe the most important of them, is: what does the world require now? The answer to this question allows us to rise above just ourselves and contribute to the larger cause of humanity. For those of you who are fortunate to have activities at the intersection at questions one and four, voila, you have a mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, ikigai is the harmonious synergy of all these four questions. In other words it urges you to find an activity which could be a profession, passion, vocation and mission for you at the same time. Pretty confounding if you ask me. Now it might not be easy to find this sweet spot in one go. It might take quite a while actually. But the journey involved in finding your ikigai can be quite satisfying. It can also serve as a guiding light for rethinking some of your favourite activities. Say you like teaching and see it as a viable profession: maybe 5 or 10 years down the line. Now how would we transform this into something the world needs. Well it so happens that quality education is number 4 on the UN &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sustainable Development Goals&lt;/a&gt; (SDGs) list. Off the top of my head, you could either work on making education more accessible to the global population - there are over 115 million without access to quality primary education - or work on effective communication and disttilation of knowledge (which in my opinion, is pretty important too, &lt;a href=&#34;https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;read this&lt;/a&gt; for a comprehensive article on how lack of distilling knowledge plagues schools and academia alike).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mindfulness&#34;&gt;Mindfulness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another module which deeply resonanted with me is that of mindfulness. My earliest exposure to the concept was when I picked up a book from Mom&amp;rsquo;s reading stack one afternoon and as luck would have it, I ran into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6708.The_Power_of_Now&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Power of Now&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ekhard Tole&lt;/a&gt;. The book isn&amp;rsquo;t dreadful, but it certainly was heavy for a school kid. Yet, there were a few ideas from the book that I actually did like. The idea of turning off our minds completely for a while everyday and becoming passive observers of our thought process: two very calming rituals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness is a more precise term for this broad idea of living more actively in the present, noticing the smaller details around us. It could  be as simple as stopping by to admire the fresh dew on a cold morning, or noticing how that stray cat does a weird movement with its ears everytime it gets up. But the idea is to observe, observe both passively and actively. Active in your senses, and passive so as to not let your biases and notions cloud the scene. If this sounds to you like a line &lt;em&gt;Oogway&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Kung Fu Panda&lt;/em&gt; would say, you&amp;rsquo;re probably on the right track. And since we brought up &lt;em&gt;Oogway&lt;/em&gt;, I think this line from the movie is pretty apt in this context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yesterday is history,
tomorrow is a mystery,
and today is a gift&amp;hellip;
that&amp;rsquo;s why they call it the present”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Although seemingly unconnected, I feel mindfulness shares a lot of concepts in common with other practices including time management and deliberate practice (or deep work). &lt;strong&gt;Time Management,&lt;/strong&gt; a concept, dreaded by procrastinators and capitalised by life-coaches, it certainly goes hand-in-hand with mindfulness. Most time-management practices involve to varying degrees the art of prioritizing, dividing your day into &amp;ldquo;phases&amp;rdquo; and having a plan in general. Often people who start out with such practices find it too rigid, a bit too suffocating, as though all these rules and time-chunks have begun to take control of their life. That&amp;rsquo;s precisely where one can bring in mindfulness, by paying more attention to the present, to the task at hand. This allows us to use our plans to guide us, not control us. We don&amp;rsquo;t beat ourselves up when we&amp;rsquo;re mindfully doing a task, because we know its important. We&amp;rsquo;ve conciously decided to prioritize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second connected concept to Mindfulness has to be Deliberate Practice or Deep Work. It is certainly a personal favourite of mine, ever since it has added more value to my days. At the heart of it, the idea in deep work is to push your cognitive levels to greater extents by paying more attention to your task, and focussing on just one task for long periods of time. It asks you to prioritize tasks, albeit in a very different way. What tasks among those you do routinely are those which value you the most? Where you are probably the best person to do it and generate more value through this tasks? Deep Work then asks you to relegate other logisitcal and mundane efforts, termed as &amp;ldquo;shallow work&amp;rdquo;, down your importance list. Instead, tackle your &amp;ldquo;deep tasks&amp;rdquo; first thing in the morning, or whichever part of the day you typically bring in your A-game. See the jarring similarities between the two?&lt;/p&gt;














&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop at being just a productive hack, its implications go well beyond, and plays a crucial role in other aspects of daily life. For instance, communication is one area which benefits from mindfulness. Regardless of whether you&amp;rsquo;re trying to pitch to a potential investor, persuade an unconvinced audience or just be a better listener with your social circle, mindfulness can help a lot. Next time when you listen to someone else speaking, listen without any judgement or bias. Listen without listening for the sake of just hearing the other person out. Especially when we have a script in our minds filled with what we would say next, and we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;  going to speak those lines, regardless of what the other person says. Sort of like a two-way scripted speech. Instead listen with purpose. Try to understand what they want to communicate, put yourself in their shoes and try to empathise with their situation. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably find yourself becoming someone people love to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this explanation made me recall some of my friends who always come across as great listeners. Now, they aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily reticent, in fact most of them are pretty active speakers too. However, everytime you speak to them, you would feel as though they have completely understood you. Somehow, you&amp;rsquo;re no longer the lone subject. All these people have one thing in common: they actively listen. Mindful communication was a really great take-home from this module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also able to connect Mindfulness to other modules taught in the course, one of them being social ettiequte. Being aware of others, their feelings and state of mind can certainly help push our social skills to the next level. It just makes some of the &amp;ldquo;good practices&amp;rdquo; listed under social ettiequte, which if you haven&amp;rsquo;t done them before, might seem too Victorian-era gentlelemanly for you. Holding out the door for the person in front of you, handing a person a glass of water or not interrupting people when they speak to you, can all come naturally when you actively observe and stay in the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-your-personality&#34;&gt;Understanding your Personality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this module, we were exposed to the general classification of personality traits. We started off with the rather well-known Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). An introspective self-report questionnaire based on the conceptual theory proposed by Carl Jung and Briggs Myers, who speculated that people experience the world using four principal psychological functions – sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking – and that one of these four functions is dominant for a person most of the time. These give rise to four categories:  Introversion/Extraversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, Judging/Perception, producing a total of 16 different types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first category deals with how a person draws his or her energy: whether it is through socialising and the external world (extraversion, E) or in isolation from their internal world (introversion, I). The second, Sensing-Intuition (S-N), deals with the way people perceive information, whether they rely more on external or internal stimuli for receiving this information. Thinking and Feeling (T-F) extends this to processing information, whether you are more of a logic based person or allow emotion to play a dominant role in decisions. Finally, Judging-Perceiving (J-P) .&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Turns out, its not that simple&amp;hellip;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One can take the MBTI test &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;, by answering over two dozens of questions. So I did, besides being joined by my enthusiasitc wingmates (who knew personality tests were &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; exciting?) , and was classified ENTJ. The test makes a structured assessment of your responses based on various scenarios, judged objectively and not based on the context. Throughout the theory, one might notice two main dichotomies: &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo; (thinking, feeling) and &amp;ldquo;irrational&amp;rdquo; (senstion, intuition), which originates from Jung&amp;rsquo;s classification of cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A certain way to look at the utility of this taxonomy is the way we have orientation for our hands. In the same way that writing with the left hand is difficult for a right-hander, so people tend to find using their opposite psychological preferences more difficult, though they can become more proficient (and therefore behaviorally flexible) with practice and development. One can also use this to play to their strengths, by grouping compatible people together. This is the most common way industry experts and HR professionals tend to use the MBTI. Again, it should be mentioned that these categories are not used to determine what&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; or what&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo;. The Myers &amp;amp; Briggs Foundation goes a step further and urges people to view this as diversity, to take the test with confidentiality, be their best judge (questionnaires can tend to be incorrect, and is just an indication) and be given detailled feedback when they take these tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as elegant as the MBTI theory sounds, it tends to paint a black and white picture for many grey areas. As such despite having many pyschological based research around it, the scientific community at large has come to recognise this as a pseudoscience. In a popular (&lt;em&gt;reddit?&lt;/em&gt;) joke, astrology is more accurate than the Myers-Briggs since it gets it wrong only 92% of the time, as compared to 94% inaccuracy of the personality categories. The major qualms with the method is its lack of a sound scientific basis. The assertion that dichotomies exist seem to be vaccuous, as many studies have found a normal distribution over the categories, instead of the assumed bimodal distribution. In other words, people don&amp;rsquo;t really have much of a preference, and might be as introverted as they are extroverted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A far more acceptable scale chart is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Big Five personality taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;. Also known as the five-factor model (FFM), this theory relates usage of langauge to personality traits. For example, someone described as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;conscientious&lt;/a&gt; is more likely to be described as &amp;ldquo;always prepared&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;messy&amp;rdquo;.  The five factors are: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism, giving rise to acronym OCEAN. The causality behind these traits is attributed to both genetics and upbringing, roughly evenly. Some of these traits such as conscientiousness, extraversion, openness to experience, and neuroticism tend to be relatively stable from childhood through adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Openness to experience here refers to the general appreciation for something new in one&amp;rsquo;s life, be it adventure, art or emotion. It can be associated with dynamic thinking, unpredictability (maybe not fickleness) and overall being explorative. Conversely, those who are less open-minded tend to play it &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; and stick to perseverance and a bit of dogmatisim. Conscientiousness refers to how people control their behavioural tendencies: whether they are more of self-disciplinarians or free spirits, how much one prefers planning over spontaneity. Extraversion is similar to the MBTI regime, but recognises that individuals might be a combination of the two. Agreeableness reflects individual differences in general concern for social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others, and disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others. This more or less positively correlates with one&amp;rsquo;s social relationships and negatively with military or stern leadership. Finally, neuroticism is the tendency to experience negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety, or depression. Often termed as emotional instability, it tests our emotional reactiveness to stressful scenarios. The Big Five test has also been assessed on some animal species, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2654334&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;chimpanzees&lt;/a&gt;, with concepts largely carrying forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this module gave me a valuable insight into human behavioural tendencies, even if I had to take it with a pinch of salt in certain contexts. Certainly, being concious of such flaws and limitations in these methods helps us appreciate the diversity each one of us brings to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
